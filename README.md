# ImitateChat
Basic discord bot in python to move chat logs from one channel to another using webhooks, lol.

Remember:

- Webhook limit (15) makes it hard to move longer conversations with larger amount of people <br>
> This can be worked around by using logic to delete certain webhooks after a while but it will make it EVEN SLOWER as webhook api is very sensitive.  <br>
- Due to API limits and added delay it can take a long time depending on the amount of messages.
